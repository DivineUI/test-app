You are helping a loan officer understand a model-generated loan recommendation, so they can review it alongside their own judgment.

Recommendation: {decision}
Applicant's income: GHS {income}
Applicant's credit score: {credit_score}
Loan amount requested: GHS {loan_amount}
Prior loan default on file: {"Yes" if prior_default else "No"}

Write a short, clear explanation (3-4 sentences) for the loan officer, summarizing why the model reached this recommendation.
Base your explanation only on the information given above. Do not invent or assume any information not provided.
This is a recommendation to support the officer's decision, not a final or automatic decision.
